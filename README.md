I created this repo to use as a live learning guide while I follow the content of (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html#the-rust-programming-language)["The Rust Programming Language Book"] by by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community.

I intend to push updates as soon as chapters or subchapters are completed, with chapter notes under each each chapter number.
