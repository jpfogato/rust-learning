rust-analyzer on VSCode will only activate if:

    workspaceContains:Cargo.toml
    workspaceContains:*/Cargo.toml
    workspaceContains:rust-project.json
    workspaceContains:*/rust-project.json
    workspaceContains:.rust-project.json
    workspaceContains:*/.rust-project.json

Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed
