Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed

cargo new creates a new repository initializing git in the process, unless already part of a git repo
packages of code are referred to as "crates"
cargo expects the source files to live under src directory
Cargo.lock keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies used in the project
cargo build just builds
cargo run builds + runs 
cargo check just checks your source code to ensure it is compillable
directory for the debug binary is: target/debug
cargo is OS-agnostic

to build for release:
carbo build --release
always benchmark the release software as it is optimized when compilling vs just using "cargo build"
