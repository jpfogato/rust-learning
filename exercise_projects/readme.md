This folder will hold some sample project ideas I got from LLMs to exercise the book's chapters.

## Temperature Converter:
Description: A command-line program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa.

This project is great for practicing functions, variable binding, and basic arithmetic.

### Concepts You'll Use:
Functions (one for f_to_c, one for c_to_f)
Variables and mutability
Basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
User input (from the guessing game chapter)
Control flow (if or match to choose conversion type)

### Simple Steps:
Print a menu asking the user which conversion they want to do.
Read their choice.
Prompt them to enter the temperature.
Read the temperature (remember: input is a String, you need to parse it to a number, e.g., f64).
Use an if or match statement to call the correct conversion function.
Print the result.
