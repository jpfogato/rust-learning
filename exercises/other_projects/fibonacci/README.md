## Project 2: Fibonacci Number Generator
This project focuses on control flow (loops) and simple algorithms.
Description: Generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is defined as:
F₀ = 0
F₁ = 1
Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂

### Concepts You'll Use:
Loops (for or while)
Variables and mutability (you'll need to swap values)
User input and parsing

### Simple Steps:
Prompt the user for a number n.
Handle the base cases (if n is 0 or 1).
For any larger n, use a loop to calculate the value iteratively.
You'll need to track two previous numbers (e.g., a and b).
In each loop iteration, calculate the next number and update your tracked values.
