Comparing against Tuples, structs are more flexible because we don’t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance

A struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being grouped together
Use the "struct update syntax '..'" to create a new instance of the struct that have most of the same values from another instance

Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs

We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data

using a ":?" inside a println! macro tells Rust we want to use the debug format for printing
