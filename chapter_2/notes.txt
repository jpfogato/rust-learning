Simple notes for chapter 2

cargo run is ideal for quick testing

from the root of the repository, you can run
    cargo run --bin <binary_name>
to run an specific compilation of the repository
if what you need to use is not in the prelude (standard library), it needs to be declared via "use" statemente

variables are immutable by -> DEFAULT <- 
    mut statement changes that default behavior

To comment, use //

:: means that the element after it is an associated function of that type
new is a common function associated to many types, since it is a common task to generate a new of something

let mut guess = String::new();
-> creates a mutable variable that is bound to an empty instance of the String type.

when updating a value from a referenced item (items with &), you need to also add the "mut" statement so the value of the original instance can be updated via its reference

if you see when compilling:

    warning: unused `Result` that must be used

it means that an ".expect()" method was not called for a function that can potentially return an error.

cargo understands "Semantic Versioning" (SemVer)
cargo update will update the crates version you configured in your Cargo.toml file until the last available bugfix for that MINOR release. ex: from 0.8.1 to 0.8.5; but never incrementing the minor nor major numbers.

generate documentation for the used crates via:
    cargo doc --open
