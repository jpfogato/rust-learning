it is important to learn the keywords. They are here:

Differences between a constant and a variable
    Constants are not allowed to be mutable
    Constant declaration: const
    Variable declaration: let
    Type of the value for a constant MUST be annotated (const CONSTANT : <Type> = "value";)

Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words

Shadowing a variable in an inner scope, does not mutate its value in an outer scope

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time

To get a very detailed explanation of an error detected at compile time we can use:
    rustc --explain <ERROR_CODE>

Rust has four primary scalar types:
- integers: 
    - number without a fractional component (i or u -> 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 bits).
    - Integer literals support decimal, hex, octal, binary and byte notations
    - consider explicitly handling overflows when manipulating integers by using these methods:
        Example: adding 10 to 250 results in an overflow
        wrapping_* -> wrapping_add: 250 + 10 = 4
        checked_* -> checked_add: overflow!
        overflowing_* -> overflowing_add: 4, overflow? true
        staurating_* -> saturating_add: 255
    - division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer

- floating-point numbers: 
    - numbers with decimal points (f32 and f64 (default))
    - all operators allowed in Rust are described here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-02-operators.html
    
- Booleans
    - one byte in size
    - specified using bool, values: true, false

- characters
    - the language’s most primitive alphabetic type
    - char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value
